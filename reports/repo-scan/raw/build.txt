(node:4890) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///workspace/smarepo-saas/lib/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /workspace/smarepo-saas/package.json.
